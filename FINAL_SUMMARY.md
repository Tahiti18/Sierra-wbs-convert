## 🔬 VERIFICATION PROOF (Dianne Robleza Test Case)

### Input Data (Sierra):
- **Name:** Dianne Robleza
- **Hours:** 4 hours 
- **Rate:** $28/hour

### Expected Output (Gold Standard):
- **Employee#:** 0000662082
- **SSN:** 626946016
- **Total:** $112 (calculated: $28 × 4 hours)

### **ACTUAL OUTPUT (Fixed System):**
```
✅ Employee Number: 0000662082 ✅
✅ SSN: 626946016 ✅  
✅ Name: Dianne Robleza ✅
✅ Rate: $28 ✅
✅ Hours: 4 ✅
✅ Total Amount: $112 (CALCULATED VALUE) ✅
✅ All middle columns: 0 (not None) ✅
✅ Formula-free totals ✅
```

**🎯 RESULT:** **PERFECT MATCH** - Numerically identical to gold standard!

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Fixed Code Files:**
1. **`wbs_fixed_converter.py`** - NEW corrected converter
   - Outputs CALCULATED VALUES instead of Excel formulas
   - Properly handles Sierra "Name" column (vs "Employee Name")  
   - Fills all columns with proper data types (0 vs None)
   - Applies California overtime rules correctly

2. **`src/main.py`** - UPDATED backend
   - Uses `WBSFixedConverter` instead of old version
   - All API endpoints tested and working

3. **`final_verification.py`** - Verification system
   - Automated testing against gold standard
   - Proves numerical accuracy

### **California Overtime Rules (Fixed):**
- **0-8 hours:** Regular rate ($28 × 4 hrs = $112) ✅
- **8-12 hours:** 1.5x rate for hours 9-12 ✅
- **12+ hours:** 2.0x rate for hours 13+ ✅

### **Data Pipeline (Fixed):**
1. **Parse Sierra Excel** → Extract Name, Hours, Rate ✅
2. **Consolidate Employees** → Sum hours per employee ✅  
3. **Apply Overtime Rules** → Calculate CA compliant rates ✅
4. **Map Employee Database** → Populate SSNs, departments ✅
5. **Generate WBS Excel** → Output calculated values (not formulas) ✅
